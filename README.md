# next-prime-number
In this practice i learned the use of helper function (function for finding prime numbers) 
To de-compose bigger and more confusing projects. Also i learned how to find the next prime number in a given array.
I also learned that i am able to "true" in a while loop meaning that the loop will run as long as the conditions are true
